# Coding-Portfolio-Project
A collection of my academic and personal programming projects in software engineering, AI, and web development

# 1. Number-Guessing-Game
This project involved developing an Advanced Number Guessing Game using Python as a console-based application. The purpose of this project was to apply fundamental programming concepts in a practical and interactive way while improving logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

-Technology used: Python (random library)

# What I have learnt:
*control structures: loops and conditional statements to manage the game flow

*functions: organize the code into smaller, reusable components

*implementing exception handling using try-except

# Future Improvements:
*add a GUI version

# 2. BMI Calculator
The BMI Calculator is a Python program that computes a person’s Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. It categorizes the BMI into standard health ranges: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity. The program solves the problem of having to calculate BMI manually by showing quick results and categorizes the BMI into standard health range.

-Technology used: Python

# What I have learnt:
*Validates user input to prevent error from occuring

*handle multiple calculations

*control flow, user input handling

# Future Improvements:
*add a GUI version to enhance usability

*include age and gender

# 3. Smart Weather Checking App
The smart weather checking app provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide. It solves the problem of needing to check weather forecasts by offering a quick, detailed weather reports with recommendations.

-Technology used: Python (requests, json)

# What I have learnt:
*Error handling 

*Integrating API using the weather API

*File Operations so that it can implement data export functionality

# Future Improvements:
*add weather alerts for severe conditions

*add favourite cities for quick access

*add a 5-day weather forecast feature
